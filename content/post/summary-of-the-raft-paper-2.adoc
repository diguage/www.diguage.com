在上一篇文章中，通过阅读 https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf[《In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm》] 前三节的内容，对论文的大致内容做了简介，简单说明了一下 Replicated state machines 的用途以及 Paxos 本身存在的问题。

== 4. Designing for understandability

[quote]
____
several goals in designing Raft: 

* it must providea complete and practical foundation for system building;
* it must be safe under all conditions and available under typical operating conditions; 
* it must be efficient for common operations.

Our most important goal -- and most difficult challenge -- was **understandability**.
____

从这里可以看出，Raft 设计的初衷就是为了易于理解和便于构建。

[quote]
There were numerous points in the design of Raft where we had to choose among alternative approaches. In these situations we evaluated the alternatives based on understandability.

总之，一切出发点就是易于理解。但是，这里就有一个疑问了，在整个设计中，有没有什么地方为了理解而舍弃效率？有哪些地方？如何改进？

[quote]
____
We used two techniquesthat are generally applicable:

* The first technique is the well-known approach of problem decomposition: wherever possible, we divided problems into separate pieces that could be solved, explained, and understood relatively independently.
* Our second approach was to simplify the state spaceby reducing the number of states to consider, making the system more coherent and eliminating nondeterminism where possible.
____

从目录来看，这两个

[quote]
We used randomization to simplify the Raft leader election algorithm.

在选举中，定时器的时长是随机的，确实可以减少冲突发生的概率。

[quote]
Raft implements consensus by first electing a distinguished leader, then giving the leader complete responsibility for managing the replicated log.


[quote]
____
Raft decomposes the consensus problem into three relatively independent subproblems:

* **Leader election**: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails;
* **Log replication**: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with its own;
* **Safety**: the key safety property for Raft is the State Machine Safety Property in Figure 3: if any serverhas applied a particular log entry to its state machine,then no other server may apply a different commandfor the same log index.

=== 5.1  Raft basics

[quote]
____
At any given time each server is in one of three states: leader, follower, orcandidate. In normal operation thereis exactly one leader and all of the other servers are fol-lowers.

Followers issue no requests ontheir own but simply respond to requests from leaders and candidates.

The leader handles all client requests.

Candidate is used to elect a new leader.
____

Follower 不处理请求，只响应 Leader 和 Candidate 的请求。

Leader 处理所有的 Client 请求。
